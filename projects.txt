In campaing periods, A lot of suppliers have been uploading at same time, 
There was a alot of corrrenct process,
 When many users have started to upload their excel file at the same time,  the backend microservices which called by releated UI,
was not able to respond.

We have been validating every line of excel and this process take a time as sync.

TThen I created async structure using rabbitmq, publsh queue than another microservice consume it, then validate.
